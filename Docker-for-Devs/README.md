#  Docker for Devs Workshop

Docker and containers are getting a lot of attention these days but what do they mean for devs? How do they fit into DevOps and continuous delivery movements? Where do these tools fit into cloud computing? During this hands-on session we will learn how to install and configure Docker, build images and run containers in a local development environment. But we will also explore using them in a continuous deployment environment by deploying them to on premise as well as cloud services such as AWS.
