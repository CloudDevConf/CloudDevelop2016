# DevOps In Action

## Abstract

DevOps aims to remove hurdles from getting features deployed to production by standardizing and automating the delivery pipeline, and Agile processes aim to make the act of development itself more efficient and incremental. The session will begin with a short intro to Release Management followed by an end to end demo of deploying and testing an ASP.NET 5, MVC 6 application in a Docker container to a Linux machine in Azure using Release Management online. We will be using the latest Build and Release Management UI from Visual Studio Team Services and Release Management Online. Attend this session so you can understand how things are changing and what tools are available to help you keep pace with the developer evolution.
