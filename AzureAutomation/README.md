# Being Efficient with Azure Automation

## Abstract

Individual humans do not scale very well.  Let's face it, we can barely multitask.  So with Cloud Computing how do we keep up with the growing demand for maintenance tasks for these "infinitely scalable" assets?  The answer is automation.  

Azure Automation is a highly available automation service which helps you "Automate all the things".  Anything from deployments, to monitoring to maintenance tasks can be set up using this reliable workflow execution engine.  This presentation covers the fundamentals of the Azure Automation service and provides some insights into how to leverage it with your own solutions.

## Notes

My slides can be found in the PDF file in this folder. Since I'm not a fan of bullet points they will not be as useful as attending the session was. There are a ton of resources on the internet for learning more about Azure Automation, but I recommend the Learning Path from the Automation documentation pages as the best place to start.
