# Azure App Service to Create Web and Mobile Apps

## Abstract

Azure has finally combined everything the mobile developer needs into one package. The Microsoft Azure App Service is a new, fully managed Platform as a Service (PaaS), that combines the existing functionality of Azure Websites and Azure Mobile Services with the exciting new features of API Apps (SaaS APIs) and Logic Apps (SaaS apps). Using all, or some, of these app services can accelerate development when creating integrated web and mobile solutions. This talk will provide an overview of the main points that App Service has to offer. With a focus on minimizing costs, these services will be combined to create a robust sample application. With lots of example code, attendees will leave with a clear idea of how to architect apps using this enterprise-ready platform.
